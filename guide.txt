Any participating users must opt one person into utilising the server tool for other clients to connect to. As the host, you may connect to the server tool using the client by simply entering your loopback address as well as this programs standard port - port 80.

To utilise this tool over the internet, I recommend using Hamachi to initialise a virtual private network.

Support for this tool is no longer in place - optimal security procedures may not be in place so please do not share any sensitive information via public networks nor use within a network that may compromise the security of other persons on the network.

Use at your own risk, thank you for viewing my software!
